The Four Corners Science and Computing Club wants to give a big thanks to [Duane
Koyawena](https://www.dkoyawenaarts.com/) for designing the new 4CSCC graphic. It combines elements of cultural
importance such as agriculture (corn, beans, squash), the Colorado River, and
the four corners states (Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah) with
microchips, scientific computing, and environmental data collection. It is our
hope that with this graphic we give thanks to indigenous ancestors, represent
the importance of the land and water, and promote diversity and inclusion in
open-source scientific software development. Thanks, Duane, for your hard work,
time, and patience through the design process. Check out Duane’s work at his
site [here](https://www.dkoyawenaarts.com/).

Our new graphic supports our Indigenous Land Acknowledgement which is presented
at the beginning of each workshop. It states, “Northern Arizona University sits
at the base of the San Francisco peaks, on homelands sacred to Native Americans
throughout the region. We honor their past, present, and future generations,
who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.” It is
important to recognize our history, support our neighbors and community, and
integrate the voices of diverse peoples in order to prepare 21st century
learners for careers in scientific computing.
