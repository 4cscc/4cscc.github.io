The Four Corners Science and Computing Club (4CSCC) is a program focused on building awareness of and interest in the use of computers in science.
Our target audience is middle school through college students at schools primarily or largely serving Native American populations.

Our short-term aim is to empower students by illuminating pathways to impactful and lucrative careers in scientific computing, and our long-term aim is to increase representation and inclusion of Native Americans in open source scientific computing.

Our project is led by professors and students at [Northern Arizona University](https://www.nau.edu) and [Fort Lewis College](https://www.fortlewis.edu/).
