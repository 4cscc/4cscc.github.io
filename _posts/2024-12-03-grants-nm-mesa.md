# New Mexico MESA STEAM Rally

The Four Corners Science and Computing Club was thrilled to accept the call to join New Mexico MESA, inc. at New Mexico State University – Grants campus on Tuesday, December 3, 2025.  The New Mexico Mathematics, Engineering, and Science Achievement, NM MESA, is a pre-college program that prepares students for college and careers in STEM fields. Coordinated through six regional offices at institutions – the University of New Mexico, New Mexico Highlands University, and New Mexico State University, MESA also supports middle and high school programs led by STEM teachers. Students engage in math, science, and engineering activities, including field trips, workshops, competitions, and leadership projects, with MESA providing funding and support. Its mission is to empower and motivate New Mexico’s diverse students with STEM enrichment, and its vision is to develop diverse, well-educated professionals who achieve their full potential as STEM leaders.

The MESA STEAM Rally invited exhibitors to provide K-12 students with hands-on STEAM activities, and there was also a mini-health and college fair.  The vast resources revealed many opportunities for students to enhance their learning for success.  Our booth exhibited various lessons and exercises from the 4CSCC lesson book, featuring our Raspberry Pi 400 mobile kit and introductory micro:bit exercises.  Students from varied backgrounds and age ranges allow us to gain firsthand knowledge for creating scientific computing lessons.  Exhibiting 4CSCC’s work benefits teachers as they gain insight into approaching STEM curriculum for their classes.
Students were dispersed into groups of nine, with each group concentrating on unique STEM topics focused on math, biology, and chemistry exploration, and career readiness for nursing, electrical engineering, and data science.  Sessions were available throughout the day and offered students a chance to gain knowledge from experts in the world of STEAM.  The goals of NM MESA align with those of the 4CSCC, as we strive to enhance the learning of K-12 students and undergraduates throughout Native American communities throughout the Four Corners.
