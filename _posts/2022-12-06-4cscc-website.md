The Four Corners Science and Computing Club (4CSCC) website is now live at [https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org](https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org).

You can find an early draft of our scientific computing curriculum in the [Lab Manual](https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org/lab-manual/).

We expect to expand the content available on this website soon.
