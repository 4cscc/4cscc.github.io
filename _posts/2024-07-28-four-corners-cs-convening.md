# 4 Corners Computer Science Convening
The 4 Corners Computer Science Convening is a three-day conference â€“ June 23 thru 26, showcasing computer science education for Indigenous students and hosted by Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado.  K-12 educators and administrators involved with Native American students include CS teachers connecting with others to incorporate Indigenous teachings with CS.  The event began Sunday, June 23 with a welcome and networking dinner, the Fire Side Chat with elders carried an interesting aspect on traditional Navajo teachings and using technology as a tool, one elder shared a desire for a computer greeting in Dine Bazaad (Navajo Language).
## Presentation Day
On Monday, June 24, 4CSCC members Franklin, Jeff, and Simon presented a two-hour session highlighting physical computing as a gateway to scientific computing. See more information about our event here.  Our audience consisted of computer science educators, primarily from Native American communities.  We began our presentation by outlining shared insights into our program and recent collaborations in the Four Corners region.  Our role modeling of Socratic questioning focused on a slide that contained an image of a chemical spill outside of Tucson, Arizona. This activity effectively stimulated interest and critical thinking as participants analyzed the image and brainstormed ways to figure out its context.
