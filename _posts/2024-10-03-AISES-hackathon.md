# 2024 AISES National Conference Hackathon
The Four Corners Science and Computing Club had the pleasure of partnering with Chevron to host this year’s student hackathon at the 2024 AISES National Conference.  Our session took place the evening of October 3, 2024, and marks 4CSCC’s and Chevron’s second collaboration.  Over 80 high school and college students participated in the five-hour session.  Students represented various schools throughout the U.S., our furthest participants were from New York and Canada.  Other participants included their chaperones and educators from various schools.

We started the event by introducing students to the Chevron and 4CSCC teams and presented to our audience the 4CSCC mobile Raspberry Pi mobile kit, our Micro:bit lessons, and the environmental sensor curriculum.  We then had students work in teams to present an environmental issue they would like to address and benefit their community and increase environmental awareness.  This approach challenged teams to strategize and develop their skills and offered networking opportunities.  Students shared intricate projects on air quality, water treatment, and wearable technology; they later submitted their projects and were scored based on the merit set by Chevron and 4CSCC.

We would like to thank Chevron and AISES for inviting 4CSCC to lead the student hackathon.  These sessions offer 4CSCC to increase our reach to schools beyond the four corners.  The AISES National Conference also provided us opportunities to network and seek out more organizations involved in a similar mission to broaden Native American representation and interest in STEM.
