In recent collaboration with Institute of Tribal Environmental Professionals (ITEP), 4CSCC had the privilege of participating in another STEM-sation event for Tuba City High School in Tuba City, AZ. Teaming up, we showcased our latest air qualitystudent projects.  Our booth demonstrated the 4CSCC Raspberry Pi 400 mobile kit. During presentations and discussion, led by Franklin, we emphasized the importance of monitoring our physical surroundings to enhance air quality. The interactive sessions delved into 4CSCC lessons and exercises, which revealed how common household items had affected our environmental data sensors.

The students exhibited keen interest in various aspects of scientific computing elements, i.e., code usage and how data sensors get readings.  There was also curiosity regarding web development and hardware intricacies. In response, we provided additional resources to fuel their passion for coding and programming.

In addition, 4CSCC and ITEP shared student contributions and valuable insights into environmental education topics, such as water and air quality management. Other STEM organizations present engaged students in hands-on experiments, offering a glimpse into extensive career opportunities within the STEM field.  Participating in such events goes beyond showcasing our projects; it's a way of giving back to the future leaders of STEM. Utilizing the 4CSCC lessons and tools proves to be an effective approach to inspiring those with a budding interest in STEM. The accompanying photos capture moments of students actively participating in lessons and experiments.
