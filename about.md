The Four Corners Science and Computing Club is being developed by CZI principal investigators at Northern Arizona University (Flagstaff, Arizona, USA) and Fort Lewis College (Durango, Colorado, USA) as an effort to increase interest in and awareness of the role of computers in science before students get to college.

This effort aims to illustrate pathways into open source scientific software development for Native American middle school, high school, and college students in the Four Corners region of the USA (Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona), with the long-term goal of increasing representation of Native Americans in the field.
