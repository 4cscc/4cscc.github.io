Greetings, I'm Kayden Vicenti, a member of the Jicarilla Apache Nation and half Navajo. I'm a junior at Northern Arizona University studying software and electrical engineering. This past summer, I collaborated with the Four Corners Science and Computing Club (4CSCC) on a research project. My role was to develop a culturally responsive workshop that seamlessly combined computer and environmental science. To accomplish this, I created a short lesson plan, which allowed others to implement the technical components effectively. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into crafting a culturally inclusive curriculum. I exposed myself to different software and electronics, MicroPython and Raspberry Pi Pico W, and explored their application within our research. This journey has ignited my enthusiasm for both technology and cultural inclusivity in the world of science.
