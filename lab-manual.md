# Lab Manual

At this point, we have developed two lab manuals that can be used as a stand-alone resource for science and other teachers to integrate scientific computing into their classroom.

## BBC micro:bit
Our most recent version, and the one we recommend, is based on the BBC Micro:bit platform. You can find this content at: [https://4cscc-microbit.readthedocs.io/](https://4cscc-microbit.readthedocs.io/).

## Raspberry Pi
Our original lab manual was based on the Raspberry Pi 400 platform, and still contains some content that hasn't been developed for our Micro:bit version yet. You can find that content at: [https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org/lab-manual/](https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org/lab-manual/).
