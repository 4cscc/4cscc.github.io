# Lab Manual

We have developed two lab manuals that can be used as a stand-alone resource for science and other teachers to integrate scientific computing into their classroom.
### Raspberry Pi
You can find an early draft of our [4CSCC Lab Manual here](https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org/lab-manual/).
### BBC micro:bit
We have also established lessons for using the [BBC Micro:bit found here](https://four-corners-scientific-computing.org/4cscc-lab-manual-microbit-makecode/intro.html#).
